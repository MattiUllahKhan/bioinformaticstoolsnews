    "description": "Biology is continuously evolving and programming is not just for computer science students. Biologists can also learn it and get benefits of it , like big data summerization and analysis. So as far biology gets into experimental aspect of life it is essential for many biologists to get hands on practice thousands of tools developed in different programming languages like R , Python and Javascript.",

As per my whole career I always opted for advancement and more automation compared to larger amout of tools available on internet. In the last step we will discuss about how to make pipelines in programming to automate the data."
